## About
This application quickly changes the finder between showing and not showing hidden files.

Stick it on your Finder toolbar for quick access. Or stick it in your dock. Or grab it via spotlight. Or do whatever the hell you do to launch applications quickly.

It is just an Automator application wrapping an AppleScript.

This needs an icon.

## Requirements
Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4 or greater
